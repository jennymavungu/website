        <p>Faith House was founded in 2019  to address the needs of the growing numbers of vulnerable people in the UK and in Africa, whose their life have been ruined, marginalised or neglected and who had nowhere to turn to for help. Faith House was named by its founders, Jenny Mavungu and partnerships, who were inspired by one of the parables in the bible. It is found in Hebrews chapter 11, verse1. “Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see”. “Faith can move mountains. If someone beliefs and confidence are strong enough, they can achieve something that is very difficult”. The Faith House works to do the same putting our faith into action to improve people's life in UK and Africa no matter how the society works.
